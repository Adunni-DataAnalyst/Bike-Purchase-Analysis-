Bike Purchase Analysis Project

 *Overview* 

This project analyzes the relationship between demographic factors and bike purchasing behavior. The dataset includes information on marital status, gender, income, children, education, home ownership, car ownership, commute distance, region, age, and bike purchase status.

 *Data Preprocessing* 
- Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency
- Classified income earners into low, middle, and high-income categories
- Classified age groups into young, middle-aged, and old categories

Analysis
- Created pivot tables to analyze the relationship between bike purchases and:
    - Age brackets (middle-aged had the highest number of purchases)
    - Gender (males had slightly higher purchases than females)
    - Marital status (married individuals had higher purchases)
    - Income earners (middle-income earners had the highest number of purchases)
- Created visualizations to illustrate the findings

Tools Used
- Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization

 *Insights* 
The analysis reveals that middle-aged individuals, males, married individuals, and middle-income earners are more likely to purchase bikes. These insights can be useful for marketing and sales strategies.

 *Future Work* 
Further analysis could explore additional factors influencing bike purchasing behavior, such as commute distance and region.
